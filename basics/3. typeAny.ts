// Basic type any
// let salary;
// salary = 5000;
// Even after assigning a value to our variable - type will be any, because our variable was declared without type annotation.

// to avoid this you should add type annotation:
// let salary: number:
// salary = 5000;
// Try to not use type any in your code
